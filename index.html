    <p style="font-size: large;">Dear Erlene,</p>
    <p>This day is a special day for you, and I just want to take a moment to tell you how extraordinary it was to see you again at that very day,
      it was quite unexpected really, to encounter one of my previous classmate and as a person who helped me at some points in time. Our meeting
      might have been awkward, but nevertheless, I am grateful. You might not know that your casual mydays and posts about those inspiring 
      quotes about life had helped some people who are browsing through social media brighten up their day, it helped them, including me, hence, 
      I am very thankful. It was such a great night to not only be accompanied by my bestfriends, but to encounter 
      such a beauty as well. Charr...
    </p>
    <p>I hope this year brings you as much joy and happiness as you bring to those around you. 
      May all your dreams come true and may you find new adventures waiting just for you. Happy Birthday Erlene...</p>
